***About me***

Hi there! I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about cloud computing, DevOps, and automation. Also a Computer Systems Engineer. My main focus is on Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, Terraform, Git, etc) as I work towards transitioning into a cloud engineering role. Currently, I'm studying for the AZ-104 certification and exploring hands-on projects to gain practical experience.

🔹 Professional Background
    Currently i've been working as a Technical Support Specialist for 3 years. I have little experience working with Azure and 365 in my current role, and I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies.

🔹 Learning & Growth
    I'm a strong believer in continuous learning. I have completed cloud-related certifications like Microsoft AZ-900, and I'm currently diving deeper into cloud security, infrastructure as code (IaC), and automation. I 
    also enjoy working on hands-on projects within the AWS Free Tier to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

🔹 Tech Interests

  ☁ Cloud Computing (AWS & Azure)
 🔧 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, GitHub Actions)
  🛠 DevOps & Automation
 🤖 Exploring AI & Machine Learning in the Cloud

🔹 Personal Growth
    Aside from tech, I believe in discipline, consistency, and self-improvement. I approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset, and I'm always looking for ways to improve, both professionally and personally.

🚀 Always open to collaboration and new learning opportunities!
